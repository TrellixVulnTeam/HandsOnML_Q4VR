# Hands-On Machine Learning

My version of the code for the second edition of the book "Hands-On Machine
Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras and TensorFlow" by Aur√©lien Geron.

The original code for the book can be found at the book's
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml2).

Just like the original code, the code in this repository is licensed under the
Apache 2.0 license.

My current plan is to use PyTorch/Skorch for the Deep Learning examples, but
we'll see how this turns out.
